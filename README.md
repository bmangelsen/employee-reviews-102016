# **Employee Reviews**
These class files hold employee and department information. Employee objects are initialized with name, email, phone number, and salary, and department objects are initialized with name. The following can be accomplished:

  * Employees can be added to a department
  * Total department salary can be calculated
  * Review text can be added to employees
  * Based on review, employees are determined to be performing satisfactorily or not
  * Raises can be given to individual employees, or distributed to a department as a whole, based on department employee reviews
